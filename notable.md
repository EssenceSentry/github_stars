I couldn't find a note-taking app that ticked all the boxes I'm interested in: notes are written and rendered in GitHub Flavored Markdown, no WYSIWYG, no proprietary formats, I can run a search & replace across all notes, notes support attachments, the app isn't bloated, the app has a pretty interface, tags are indefinitely nestable and can import Evernote notes (because that's what I was using before).

So I built my own.

Part of this comparison is personal opinion: you may disagree on the UI front, things I consider bloat may be considered features by somebody else etc. but hopefully this comparison did a good job at illustrating the main differences.

## Features

### Markdown-based

Notes are written in GitHub Flavored Markdown, and you can also write [KaTeX](https://katex.org) expressions, [Mermaid](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid) diagrams and so much more, check out our full [Markdown cheatsheet](https://cheatsheet.notable.app).

Notable also gives you a very powerful Markdown editor, it's the same one VS Code uses in fact, so features like multi-cursors, a minimap and best-in-class syntax highlighting are built-in.

  </a>
</p>

### No Vendor Lock-In

Notes and attachments are simply stored on your disk, this is extremely portable and powerful: you could edit your notes with your favorite editor, have them synchronized via Dropbox, run Git on them, run a regex-based search and replace on them etc.

  </a>
</p>

### Dark Theme

A dark theme is also available. In the future support for [custom themes](https://github.com/notable/notable/issues/104) will be added as well.

If you'd like to change a color or hide a button you are also free to do that via the Devtools.

  </a>
</p>

### Zen Mode

Zen mode provides a minimalistic editing and reading experience, hiding everything that's not necessary.

Notable is also keyboard friendly, has a [quick open](https://img.notable.app/screenshot-quickopen.png) window, and we'll soon add a [command palette](https://github.com/notable/notable/issues/338) too, so you won't have to click any buttons if you don't want to.

  </a>
</p>

### Multi-Note Editor

A multi-note editor is available for quickly running an action, like favoriting, pinning, deleting, tagging etc., on multiple notes at once.

If you need to run a more complex action on your notes remember that they are just file stored on your disk so you can do whatever you want with them.

  </a>
</p>

### Split Editor

A split-editor is available for quickly checking out how your note will be rendered while you're editing it.
