Questionnaire before starting a project

There are 3 questionnaire's

1. General
2. [Backend](backend/README.md)
3. [Frontend](frontend/README.md)

Its good to make the right decisions that are hard to change, like choosing a programming language, database etc.

## General

- [ ] How much of the scope is known before the start of the project ?
- [ ] Is there a specific time frame to complete the project ?
- [ ] Can you define iterations which can sensibly quantify the progress of the project ?
- [ ] Do you have the functional requirement document (FRD) or you want us to create it ?
- [ ] Do you have any designs/wireframes for the requirement? Would you want us to do it?
