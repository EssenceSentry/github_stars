## About

**RAWGraphs** is an open web tool to create custom vector-based visualizations on top of the amazing [d3.js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) library by [Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/).
It has been developed by [DensityDesign Research Lab](http://www.densitydesign.org/) ([Politecnico di Milano](http://www.polimi.it/)) and [Calibro](http://calib.ro/), and sustained through a corporate stewardship by [ContactLab](http://contactlab.com/it/).

Primarily conceived as a tool for designers and vis geeks, RAWGraphs aims at providing a missing link  between spreadsheet applications (e.g. Microsoft Excel, Apple Numbers, Google Docs, OpenRefine, …) and vector graphics editors (e.g. Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, …).

RAWGraphs works with [tabular data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_(information)) (e.g. spreadhseets and comma-separated values) as well as with copied-and-pasted texts from other applications (e.g. Microsoft Excel, TextWrangler, TextEdit, …). Based on the [SVG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svg) format, visualizations can be easily edited with vector graphics applications for further refinements, or directly embedded into web pages.

Knowing the need of working with sensitive information, the data injected into RAWGraphs is processed only by the web browser: **no server-side operations or storages are performed** and no one will see, touch or copy your data!

RAWGraphs is also highly customizable and extensible, accepting new custom layouts defined by users. For more information about how to add or edit layouts, see the [Developer Guide](https://github.com/rawgraphs/raw/wiki/Developer-Guide).

## Usage
The easiest way to use RAWGraphs is by accessing the most updated version on the **[official app page](http://app.rawgraphs.io)**. However, RAWGraphs can also run locally on your machine: see the installation instructions below to know how.

## Installation
If you want to run your instance of RAWGraphs locally on your machine, be sure you have the following requirements installed.

### Requirements

- [git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Bower](http://bower.io/#installing-bower)

### Instructions

Clone RAWGraphs from the command line:

``` sh
$ git clone https://github.com/rawgraphs/raw.git
```

browse to RAWGraphs root folder:

``` sh
$ cd raw
```

install client-side dependencies:

``` sh
$ bower install
```

add analytics script:

``` sh
$ cp js/analytics.sample.js js/analytics.js
```

open the file ```js/analytics.js``` and add your analytics code (if any), otherwise leave the file as is.

You can now run RAWGraphs from your local web server. For example, you can run Python's built-in server:

``` sh
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 4000
```

or for Python 3+

``` sh
$ python -m http.server 4000
```

Once this is running, go to [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/).

Troubles with the installation? Maybe a look at the [issues](https://github.com/rawgraphs/raw/issues) page can solve your problem, otherwise join the [Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/densitydesign-raw).


## Documentation and Support

Documentation and FAQs about how to use RAWGraphs can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/rawgraphs/raw/wiki/).

## Charts

Information about the available charts can be found [here](https://github.com/rawgraphs/raw/wiki/Available-Charts). Adding new charts is very easy in RAWGraphs, see how [here](https://github.com/rawgraphs/raw/wiki/Adding-New-Charts)!

If you have any suggestion or request about new layouts to include, please let us know! If you have already created new charts and you would like to see them included into Raw, please send us a [pull request](https://github.com/rawgraphs/raw/pulls).
