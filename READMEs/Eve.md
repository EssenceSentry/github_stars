Eve is a programming language based on years of research into building a human-first programming platform. 

**This repository hosts a preview of Eve v0.3 alpha, which is no longer under active development.**

## Getting Started with Eve v0.3 preview

Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for your platform, then clone and build the [Eve starter repository](https://github.com/witheve/eve-starter):

```
git clone git@github.com:witheve/eve-starter.git
cd eve-starter
npm install
```

You can start the program switcher, which allows you to browse included example programs:

```
npm start
```

Or you can run a specific program by providing its path as an argument:

```
npm start -- path/to/program.js
```

## Integrating Eve into an existing project

You can get Eve as an npm package

```
npm install witheve@preview
```

Then import Eve to use it in your project

```
import {Program} from "witheve";
```

## Learning Eve

You can learn about Eve with the following resources:

- [Read the Quick Start Tutorial](http://play.witheve.com/) (use Chrome for best results)
- [Syntax Quick Reference](https://witheve.github.io/assets/docs/SyntaxReference.pdf)
- [Language Handbook (draft)](http://docs.witheve.com)

Also, the [mailing list archive](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/eve-talk) is a good resource for help and inspiration. In particular, the [Puzzles & Paradoxes series](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/eve-talk/Puzzles$20$26$20Paradoxes%7Csort:date) answers a lot of questions beginners face about the Eve langauge.

## Disclaimer

Eve is currently at a very early, "alpha" stage of development. This means the language, tools, and docs are largely incomplete, but undergoing rapid and continuous development. If you encounter errors while using Eve, don't worry: it's likely our fault. Please bring the problem to our attention by [filing an issue](https://github.com/witheve/eve#how-to-file-an-issue).

As always, with pre-release software, don’t use this for anything important. We are continuously pushing to this codebase, so you can expect very rapid changes. At this time, we’re not prepared make the commitment that our changes will not break your code, but we’ll do our best to [update you](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/eve-talk) on the biggest changes.
