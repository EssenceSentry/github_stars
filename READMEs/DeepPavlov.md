## Installation

0. We support `Linux` and `Windows` platforms, `Python 3.6` and `Python 3.7`
    * **`Python 3.5` is not supported!**
    * **installation for `Windows` requires `Git`(for example, [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)) and  `Visual Studio 2015/2017` with `C++` build tools installed!**

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    * `Linux`
    ```
    python -m venv env
    source ./env/bin/activate
    ```
    * `Windows`
    ```
    python -m venv env
    .\env\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```
2. Install the package inside the environment:
    ```
    pip install deeppavlov
    ```

## QuickStart

There is a bunch of great pre-trained NLP models in DeepPavlov. Each model is
determined by its config file.

List of models is available on
[the doc page](http://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/master/features/overview.html) in
the `deeppavlov.configs` (Python):

```python
from deeppavlov import configs
```

When you're decided on the model (+ config file), there are two ways to train,
evaluate and infer it:

* via [Command line interface (CLI)](#command-line-interface-cli) and
* via [Python](#python).

#### GPU requirements

To run supported DeepPavlov models on GPU you should have [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) 10.0
installed on your host machine and TensorFlow with GPU support (`tensorflow-gpu`)
installed in your python environment. Current supported TensorFlow version is 1.14.0.
Run

```
pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.14.0
```

before installing model's package requirements to install supported `tensorflow-gpu` version.


Before making choice of an interface, install model's package requirements
(CLI):

```bash
python -m deeppavlov install <config_path>
```

* where `<config_path>` is path to the chosen model's config file (e.g.
  `deeppavlov/configs/ner/slotfill_dstc2.json`) or just name without
  *.json* extension (e.g. `slotfill_dstc2`)


### Command line interface (CLI)

To get predictions from a model interactively through CLI, run

```bash
python -m deeppavlov interact <config_path> [-d]
```

* `-d` downloads required data -- pretrained model files and embeddings
  (optional).

You can train it in the same simple way:

```bash
python -m deeppavlov train <config_path> [-d]
```

Dataset will be downloaded regardless of whether there was `-d` flag or not.

To train on your own data you need to modify dataset reader path in the
[train config doc](http://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/master/intro/config_description.html#train-config).
The data format is specified in the corresponding model doc page. 

There are even more actions you can perform with configs:

```bash
python -m deeppavlov <action> <config_path> [-d]
```

* `<action>` can be
    * `download` to download model's data (same as `-d`),
    * `train` to train the model on the data specified in the config file,
    * `evaluate` to calculate metrics on the same dataset,
    * `interact` to interact via CLI,
    * `riseapi` to run a REST API server (see
    [doc](http://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/master/integrations/rest_api.html)),
    * `telegram` to run as a Telegram bot (see
    [doc](http://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/master/integrations/telegram.html)),
    * `msbot` to run a Miscrosoft Bot Framework server (see
    [doc](http://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/master/integrations/ms_bot.html)),
    * `predict` to get prediction for samples from *stdin* or from
      *<file_path>* if `-f <file_path>` is specified.
* `<config_path>` specifies path (or name) of model's config file
* `-d` downloads required data


### Python

To get predictions from a model interactively through Python, run

```python
from deeppavlov import build_model

model = build_model(<config_path>, download=True)

# get predictions for 'input_text1', 'input_text2'
model(['input_text1', 'input_text2'])
```

* where `download=True` downloads required data from web -- pretrained model
  files and embeddings (optional),
* `<config_path>` is path to the chosen model's config file (e.g.
  `"deeppavlov/configs/ner/ner_ontonotes_bert_mult.json"`) or
  `deeppavlov.configs` attribute (e.g.
  `deeppavlov.configs.ner.ner_ontonotes_bert_mult` without quotation marks).

You can train it in the same simple way:

```python
from deeppavlov import train_model 

model = train_model(<config_path>, download=True)
```

* `download=True` downloads pretrained model, therefore the pretrained
model will be, first, loaded and then train (optional).

Dataset will be downloaded regardless of whether there was ``-d`` flag or
not.

To train on your own data you need to modify dataset reader path in the
[train config doc](http://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/master/intro/config_description.html#train-config).
The data format is specified in the corresponding model doc page. 

You can also calculate metrics on the dataset specified in your config file:

```python
from deeppavlov import evaluate_model 

model = evaluate_model(<config_path>, download=True)
```

There are also available integrations with various messengers, see
[Telegram Bot doc page](http://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/master/integrations/telegram.html)
and others in the Integrations section for more info.


## Breaking Changes

**Breaking changes in version 0.7.0**

  [risesocket](http://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/0.7.0/integrations/socket_api.html#advanced-configuration) model-specific
  properties parametrization was changed

**Breaking changes in version 0.6.0**
- [REST API](http://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/0.6.0/integrations/rest_api.html):
  - all models default endpoints were renamed to `/model`
  - by default model arguments names are taken from `chainer.in`
    [configuration parameter](http://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/0.6.0/intro/configuration.html) instead of pre-set names
    from a [settings file](http://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/0.6.0/integrations/settings.html)
  - swagger api endpoint moved from `/apidocs` to `/docs`
- when using `"max_proba": true` in
  a [`proba2labels` component](http://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/0.6.0/apiref/models/classifiers.html) for classification,
  it will return single label for every batch element instead of a list. One can set `"top_n": 1`
  to get batches of single item lists as before

**Breaking changes in version 0.5.0**
- dependencies have to be reinstalled for most pipeline configurations
- models depending on `tensorflow` require `CUDA 10.0` to run on GPU instead of `CUDA 9.0`
- scikit-learn models have to be redownloaded or retrained

**Breaking changes in version 0.4.0!**
- default target variable name for [neural evolution](https://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/0.4.0/intro/hypersearch.html#parameters-evolution-for-deeppavlov-models)
was changed from `MODELS_PATH` to `MODEL_PATH`.

**Breaking changes in version 0.3.0!**
- component option `fit_on_batch` in configuration files was removed and replaced with adaptive usage of the `fit_on` parameter.

- rename metric functions `exact_match` to `squad_v2_em` and  `squad_f1` to `squad_v2_f1`
- replace dashes in configs name with underscores

**Breaking changes in version 0.1.0!**
- As of `version 0.1.0` all models, embeddings and other downloaded data for provided configurations are
 by default downloaded to the `.deeppavlov` directory in current user's home directory.
 This can be changed on per-model basis by modifying
 a `ROOT_PATH` [variable](http://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/master/intro/configuration.html#variables)
 or related fields one by one in model's configuration file.
 
- In configuration files, for all features/models, dataset readers and iterators `"name"` and `"class"` fields are combined
into the `"class_name"` field.

- `deeppavlov.core.commands.infer.build_model_from_config()` was renamed to `build_model` and can be imported from the
 `deeppavlov` module directly.

- The way arguments are passed to metrics functions during training and evaluation was changed and
 [documented](http://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/0.4.0/intro/config_description.html#metrics).
