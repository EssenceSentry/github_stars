# Hakaru #

Hakaru is a simply-typed probabilistic programming language, designed for easy specification of probabilistic models and inference algorithms. Hakaru enables the design of 
modular probabilistic inference programs by providing:

-  A language for representing probabilistic distributions, queries, and inferences
-  Methods for transforming probabilistic information, such as conditional probability and probabilistic inference, using computer algebra

It can be used to aid in the creation of machine-learning applications and stochastic modeling to help answer variable queries and distributions.

**Warning: This code is alpha and experimental.**

For Hakaru documentation, including an [installation guide](http://hakaru-dev.github.io/intro/installation/) and some sample programs, visit [hakaru-dev.github.io](http://hakaru-dev.github.io).
