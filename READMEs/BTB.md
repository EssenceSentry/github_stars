# Overview

BTB ("Bayesian Tuning and Bandits") is a simple, extensible backend for developing auto-tuning
systems such as AutoML systems. It provides an easy-to-use interface for *tuning* and *selection*.

It is currently being used in several AutoML systems:
- [ATM](https://github.com/HDI-Project/ATM), distributed, multi-tenant AutoML system for
classifier tuning
- [mit-d3m-ta2](https://github.com/HDI-Project/mit-d3m-ta2/), MIT's system for the DARPA
[Data-driven discovery of models](https://www.darpa.mil/program/data-driven-discovery-of-models) (D3M) program
- [AutoBazaar](https://github.com/HDI-Project/AutoBazaar), a flexible, general-purpose
AutoML system

# Install

## Requirements

**BTB** has been developed and tested on [Python 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Also, although it is not strictly required, the usage of a
[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) is highly recommended in order to avoid
interfering with other software installed in the system where **BTB** is run.

## Install with pip

The easiest and recommended way to install **BTB** is using [pip](
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```bash
pip install baytune
```

This will pull and install the latest stable release from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/).

If you want to install from source or contribute to the project please read the
[Contributing Guide](https://hdi-project.github.io/BTB/contributing.html#get-started).

# Quickstart

In this short tutorial we will guide you through the necessary steps to get started using BTB
to select and tune the best model to solve a Machine Learning problem.

In particular, in this example we will be using ``BTBSession`` to perform solve the [Wine](
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine/wine.data) classification problem
by selecting between the `DecisionTreeClassifier` and the `SGDClassifier` models from
[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) while also searching for their best hyperparameter
configuration.

## Prepare a scoring function

The first step in order to use the `BTBSession` class is to develop a scoring function.

This is a Python function that, given a model name and a hyperparameter configuration,
evaluates the performance of the model on your data and returns a score.

```python3
from sklearn.datasets import load_wine
from sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score, make_scorer
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier


dataset = load_wine()
models = {
    'DTC': DecisionTreeClassifier,
    'SGDC': SGDClassifier,
}

def scoring_function(model_name, hyperparameter_values):
    model_class = models[model_name]
    model_instance = model_class(**hyperparameter_values)
    scores = cross_val_score(
        estimator=model_instance,
        X=dataset.data,
        y=dataset.target,
        scoring=make_scorer(f1_score, average='macro')
    )
    return scores.mean()
```

## Define the tunable hyperparameters

The second step is to define the hyperparameters that we want to tune for each model as `Tunables`.

```python3
from btb.tuning import Tunable
from btb.tuning import hyperparams as hp

tunables = {
    'DTC': Tunable({
        'max_depth': hp.IntHyperParam(min=3, max=200),
        'min_samples_split': hp.FloatHyperParam(min=0.01, max=1)
    }),
    'SGDC': Tunable({
        'max_iter': hp.IntHyperParam(min=1, max=5000, default=1000),
        'tol': hp.FloatHyperParam(min=1e-3, max=1, default=1e-3),
    })
}
```

## Start the searching process

Once you have defined a scoring function and the tunable hyperparameters specification of your
models, you can start the searching for the best model and hyperparameter configuration by using
the `btb.BTBSession`.

All you need to do is create an instance passing the tunable hyperparameters scpecification
and the scoring function.

```python3
from btb import BTBSession

session = BTBSession(
    tunables=tunables,
    scorer=scoring_function
)
```

And then call the `run` method indicating how many tunable iterations you want the Session to
perform:


```python3
best_proposal = session.run(20)
```

The result will be a dictionary indicating the name of the best model that could be found
and the hyperparameter configuration that was used:

```
{
    'id': '826aedc2eff31635444e8104f0f3da43',
    'name': 'DTC',
    'config': {
        'max_depth': 21,
        'min_samples_split': 0.044010284821858835
    },
    'score': 0.907229308339589
}
 ```

# How does BTB perform?

We have a comprehensive [benchmarking framework](https://github.com/HDI-Project/BTB/tree/master/benchmark)
that we use to evaluate the performance of our `Tuners`. For every release, we perform benchmarking
against 100's of challenges, comparing tuners against each other in terms of number of wins.
We present the latest leaderboard from latest release below:

## Number of Wins on latest Version

| tuner                   | with ties | without ties |
|-------------------------|-----------|--------------|
| `Ax.optimize`           |    237    |       **39** |
| `BTB.GPEiTuner`         |    233    |           19 |
| `BTB.GPTuner`           |    235    |           25 |
| `BTB.UniformTuner`      |    197    |            2 |
| `HyperOpt.tpe`          |    206    |           11 |
| `SMAC.HB4AC`            |    192    |            1 |

| `SMAC.SMAC4HPO_LCB`     |    222    |           17 |
