# Ac**cow**nt

_Dead simple user account system so easy a ~~caveman~~ **cow** could do it._

The goal of Accownt is to be a full-featured, standalone account system that's straightforward for developers and users, easy to maintain, and as customizable as possible without introducing too much complexity.

# Install

As simple as Accownt is, you'll still need to install, configure, build, and integrate into your app. We've made it just about as easy as it could possibly be.

**Note #1:** If your system does not yet have Node installed, start with [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script) (or [nvm for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows)).

**Note #2:** You may alternatively download Accownt through npm (see [here](http://npmjs.com/package/accownt)), however this is not currently the recommended installation method. In the future we'll likely have a CLI tool available through npm to make configuring, running, and managing Accownt instances easier.

## Step 0: Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xyfir/accownt.git
cd accownt
```

From now on we'll assume commands are run from `accownt/`.

## Step 1: Download npm dependencies

Install npm depencies for each module:

```bash
cd server
npm install
cd ../web
npm install
cd ../ # back to accownt/
```

## Step 2: Set environment variables

The Accownt modules are configured via environment variables which are loaded into the applications via `.env` files located in each module's directory.

To understand the syntax of the `.env` files, know that they are first loaded via [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) and then the string values provided by dotenv are parsed by [enve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/enve).

### Step 2a: Create `.env` files

First we'll create each file by copying the example `.env` files and then we'll work our way through populating them with values.

```bash
cp server/example.env server/.env
cp web/example.env web/.env
```

### Step 2b: Edit `.env` files

Edit the files `server/.env` and `web/.env`. Update the config keys with your own values. You can find descriptions for each one under the `Accownt` -> `Env` namespaces in the [type definitions](https://github.com/xyfir/accownt/blob/master/types/accownt.d.ts). Use the appropriate `interface` for each corresponding file.

## Step 3: Build from source

```bash
cd server
npm run build
cd ../web
npm run build
cd ../
```

## Step 4: Start the server

Now you'll need to start the server and serve the built files. The simplest way to do this is:

```bash
cd server
npm run start
cd ../
```

If you're in production, you'll probably run the server with [pm2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2) and proxy the server through Nginx or Apache while serving static files through them instead of Node. For you, know that files to be served to the client are located in `web/dist` with `web/dist/index.html` serving as the web client's entry file.

## Step 5: Add Accownt to your app

This part is largely up to you, so it's important to understand the flow of data between your app and Accownt:

1. Your app sends users to Accownt's login/registration form either by user action or automatically through a forced redirection. All you need to do is get the user to Accownt, everything it needs to know is already in its config.
2. Accownt will handle everything until there's a login, at which point it will redirect the user back to your app with the JWT in the URL based on your configuration. The same JWT will _also_ be set as a cookie, so depending on your setup you may be able to and prefer to access this instead.

To be a bit more specific:

1. Somewhere in your app you'll put login and/or registration links that point to the Accownt web client.
2. If your app utilizes the JWT cookie that Accownt sets then all you need to do is verify the token with each request via [jsonwebttoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken#jwtverifytoken-secretorpublickey-options-callback) or the equivalent in your preferred language.
3. Once the JWT is verified and decoded, you can retrieve the `userId` and `email` properties from it to use however you need. Note that `userId` is a unix timestamp in milliseconds (13 digits!) that corresponds to when the user created their account. Also keep in mind that if your app is receiving a JWT, the user's email has already been verified.
4. If the JWT is invalid or expired, redirect them back to the Accownt form or to unauthenticated parts of your app.
5. Lastly, you'll need a route somewhere to catch redirections and tokens from Accownt after each successful login. You set this already in your

There are also some optional steps you can take to improve the user experience:

1. You can also add a link somewhere that takes _authenticated_ users to Accownt so they can modify their account information, like their password or 2FA.
2. You can allow users to delete their accounts by configuring the proper environment variables.

# Contribute

If you'd like to help work on Accownt, the tutorial above will suffice to get you up and running. Certain things however will make your life easier:

- Make sure your `NODE_ENV` variables in the `.env` files are set to `"development"`.
- Run the web client's dev server via `npm run start` when in `web/`. Connect to it via the `PORT` you set in `web/.env`.
- Check the `scripts` in each module's `package.json` for helpful scripts.
