# Recommenders

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/microsoft-recommenders/badge/?version=latest)](https://microsoft-recommenders.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

This repository contains examples and best practices for building recommendation systems, provided as Jupyter notebooks. The examples detail our learnings on five key tasks: 
- [Prepare Data](notebooks/01_prepare_data): Preparing and loading data for each recommender algorithm
- [Model](notebooks/02_model): Building models using various classical and deep learning recommender algorithms such as Alternating Least Squares ([ALS](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/_modules/pyspark/ml/recommendation.html#ALS)) or eXtreme Deep Factorization Machines ([xDeepFM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05170)).
- [Evaluate](notebooks/03_evaluate): Evaluating algorithms with offline metrics
- [Model Select and Optimize](notebooks/04_model_select_and_optimize): Tuning and optimizing hyperparameters for recommender models
- [Operationalize](notebooks/05_operationalize): Operationalizing models in a production environment on Azure

Several utilities are provided in [reco_utils](reco_utils) to support common tasks such as loading datasets in the format expected by different algorithms, evaluating model outputs, and splitting training/test data. Implementations of several state-of-the-art algorithms are included for self-study and customization in your own applications. See the [reco_utils documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/microsoft-recommenders/).

For a more detailed overview of the repository, please see the documents at the [wiki page](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/wiki/Documents-and-Presentations).

## Getting Started

Please see the [setup guide](SETUP.md) for more details on setting up your machine locally, on a [data science virtual machine (DSVM)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/virtual-machines/data-science-virtual-machines/) or on [Azure Databricks](SETUP.md#setup-guide-for-azure-databricks).

To setup on your local machine:

1. Install Anaconda with Python >= 3.6. [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) is a quick way to get started.

2. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/Recommenders
```

3. Run the generate conda file script to create a conda environment: (This is for a basic python environment, see [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for PySpark and GPU environment setup)

```
cd Recommenders
python scripts/generate_conda_file.py
conda env create -f reco_base.yaml  
```

4. Activate the conda environment and register it with Jupyter:

```
conda activate reco_base
python -m ipykernel install --user --name reco_base --display-name "Python (reco)"
```

5. Start the Jupyter notebook server

```
jupyter notebook
```

6. Run the [SAR Python CPU MovieLens](notebooks/00_quick_start/sar_movielens.ipynb) notebook under the `00_quick_start` folder. Make sure to change the kernel to "Python (reco)".

**NOTE** - The [Alternating Least Squares (ALS)](notebooks/00_quick_start/als_movielens.ipynb) notebooks require a PySpark environment to run. Please follow the steps in the [setup guide](SETUP.md#dependencies-setup) to run these notebooks in a PySpark environment. For the deep learning algorithms, it is recommended to use a GPU machine.

### Preliminary Comparison

We provide a [benchmark notebook](benchmarks/movielens.ipynb) to illustrate how different algorithms could be evaluated and compared. In this notebook, the MovieLens dataset is split into training/test sets at a 75/25 ratio using a stratified split. A recommendation model is trained using each of the collaborative filtering algorithms below. We utilize empirical parameter values reported in literature [here](http://mymedialite.net/examples/datasets.html). For ranking metrics we use `k=10` (top 10 recommended items). We run the comparison on a Standard NC6s_v2 [Azure DSVM](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/data-science-virtual-machines/) (6 vCPUs, 112 GB memory and 1 P100 GPU). Spark ALS is run in local standalone mode. In this table we show the results on Movielens 100k, running the algorithms for 15 epochs.
